# iota-munin-plugin
This munin plugin is useful to monitor the transactions of your neighbors over time.

To install just link the two bash files in your `/etc/munin/plugins/` folder and restart `munin-node`.

After the plugin is enabled and munin run at least once, there should be a section called iota in your munin overview.

Have fun.
